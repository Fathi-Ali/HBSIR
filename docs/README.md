# HBSIR: Household Budget Survey of Iran

Welcome to the HBSIR documentation!

The HBSIR Python package empowers researchers with streamlined access to a 
uniquely valuable dataset - the microdata behind the Iranian Household 
Expenditure and Income Survey conducted by the Statistical Center of Iran.

Drawing from over four decades of national surveys, this data provides an 
insightful window into the spending habits, consumption patterns, income 
dynamics and livelihood trajectories of Iranian households since the 1980s.

The depth, span and representativeness of the data enables multifaceted 
analysis across both time and sociodemographic dimensions. However, working 
with the raw files poses substantial burdens for data cleaning, wrangling 
and standardization across multiple survey waves.

HBSIR lifts these burdens for you. The package furnishes a high-level API for 
filtering, transforming and analyzing this unique microdataset with ease. 
Under the hood, the latest Python tools like Pandas handle the intricate 
details - enabling you to focus on extracting powerful insights.

So embark on intuitive yet sophisticated explorations of how Iranian 
households navigate income, expenditures, consumption and overall welfare. 
HBSIR hands you the keys. Where will you go?
